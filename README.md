# Tableau-Workbook-Extractor
Tableau Workbook Extractor is a Python script designed to extract .twb files and all packaged contents from a .twbx (Tableau Workbook) file, read the base64-encoded images within the .twb, and decode them into a local directory. This script is especially useful for Tableau users who want to access and manage internal resources such as shape images.
